# VideoJS Player Tester

This is a simple implementation of VideoJS ready to test.

Currently uses the version 7.6.0 of the player, which supports HLS natively. Also it is configured to use the Live UI which allows for Live DVR in HLS.

To test it go to [https://videojs-hls-test.stackblitz.io/](https://videojs-hls-test.stackblitz.io/)

This project is meant to run on StackBlitz.
